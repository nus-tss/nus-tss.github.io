These positions will be part of a grant sponsored by Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF) as part of their National Cybersecurity R&D (NCR) programme named "Fuzz Testing" which has been funded 2023-2027. This is a large research program involving several research projects that improve the reliability of modern software applications using techniques inspired from fuzz testing.

As part of this program, we will advance the state-of-the-art in testing and analysis of concurrent/ distributed / stateful software, including kernel software such as parts of the Linux Kernel. The fuzzing works should go hand in hand with automated program repair to produce and end to end solution.
