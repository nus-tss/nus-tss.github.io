### Post-doctoral Research Fellow

Applicants are invited for postdoctoral positions at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in the area of **automated testing (including fuzz testing) for concurrency**.

These positions will be part of a grant sponsored by Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF) as part of their National Cybersecurity R&D (NCR) programme named "Fuzz Testing" which has been funded 2023-2027. This is a large research program involving several research projects that improve the reliability of modern software applications using techniques inspired from fuzz testing.

As part of this program, we will advance the state-of-the-art in testing and analysis of concurrent software. The  goals of this work are (a) to develop new foundations for concurrency-centric reasoning to enhance complementary techniques like fuzz testing, (b) incorporate reasoning about modern concurrency such as memory consistency in existing and new concurrency testing and analysis techniques, and (c) applying the techniques thus developed to real world software applications, with the aim of deploying these techniques in practice with the help of our industry partners.

The program will start around June 2023, and we request interested applicants to reach out to us early with the following information. Interested applicants need to have a PhD degree or should be submitting PhD thesis soon.

Documents required:

1. CV, including publications
2. Research statement
3. Names of two referees

Other faculty members involved in this research program are Abhik Roychoudhury, Manuel Rigger and Zhenkai Liang, all from NUS Computer Science. The postdoc will be located in the Computer Science Department of NUS, which enjoys a high degree of academic reputation.
