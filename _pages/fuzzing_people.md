    <div class="title">Assistant Professor, NUS</div>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>Manuel Rigger is an Assistant Professor leading the TEST Lab, which is part of the PL/SE group at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. He is working on software reliability, data-centric systems, and programming language implementation. In his recent work, he has been focusing on automatically testing Database Management Systems, part of which he found over 450 bugs in widely-used systems such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and CockroachDB. Prior to joining NUS, Manuel was a postdoc at the Advanced Software Technologies Lab at ETH Zurich, mentored by Zhendong Su. He completed his PhD at Johannes Kepler University Linz, mentored by Hanspeter Mössenböck, where he worked on the safe and efficient execution of unsafe languages (project Sulong). Part of his work was integrated into Oracle’s GraalVM to support the execution of LLVM IR on this platform.</p>

    <div class="title">Faculty Member, Max-Planck Institute (MPI)</div>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>Marcel Böhme leads the Software Security research group at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP) in Germany. Previously, he was a Senior Lecturer at Monash University in Australia and a PostDoc at the TSUNAMi Security Research Centre in Singapore and the CISPA-Helmholtz Zentrum in Germany. Marcel received his PhD from the National University of Singapore. His current research interest is the automatic discovery of security flaws at the very large scale. One part of his group develops the probabilistic foundations of automatic software testing (i.e., finding bugs by generating executions) to elucidate fundamental limitations of existing techniques and to explore the assurances that software testing provides when no bugs are found. The other part of his group develops practical vulnerability discovery tools that are widely used in software security practice. For instance, Entropic is the default power schedule in LibFuzzer which powers the largest fuzzing platforms at Google and Microsoft, fuzzing hundreds of security-critical projects on 100k machines 24/7. His tools have discovered 100+ bugs in widely-used software systems, more than 70 of which are security-critical vulnerabilities registered as CVEs at the US National Vulnerability Database.</p>
