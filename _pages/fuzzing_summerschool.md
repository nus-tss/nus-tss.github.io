## Singapore Fuzzing Summer School 2024

The inaugural Singapore Fuzzing Summer School will debut on the week of the 20th-24th May 2024 at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) in [Singapore](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en/).
The school will focus on recent advances in fuzzing technology and the practical application of fuzz testing tools.
The school invites both postgraduate students and researchers with a relevant interest in software testing.
The school also invites industry professionals who wish to gain practical hands-on knowledge on fuzz testing tools and technologies

### Synopsis

*Fuzz testing* (a.k.a. *fuzzing*) is an automated software testing method that involves the randomized generation of very large numbers of program inputs, many of which are designed to exercise rare program behaviors with the aim of finding crashes and other software bugs.
Fuzz testing is a proven bug finding technology, and is responsible for the discovery of 1000s of real-world security vulnerabilities and other bugs.
Fuzzing is also a very active area of research within the software engineering and programming language communities, and spans the gap between research and practice.

Participants to the Singapore Fuzzing Summer School will gain insights into the latest advancements in fuzzing technology, practical experience with testing tools (AFL, libFuzzer), networking opportunities, and potential collaboration with experts and peers.

### Speakers

**TBA**

The school will invite 4-5 international experts in the area of fuzzing to give instruction.  Some additional instruction will be provided by local speakers from Singaporeâ€™s fuzzing research groups.
