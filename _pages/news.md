            2023 ICSE MIP Award for SemFix
        </div>
        <div class="news-time">
            January, 2023
        </div>
        <div class="news-details">
            <p>The work <a href="https://abhikrc.com/pdf/ICSE13-SEMFIX.pdf">SemFix</a> on program repair from our group receives the <a href="https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/icseMIPAward.html"><b>Most Influential Paper Award</b></a> from International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2023.</p>
            <p>In the paper, the authors present an automated program repair method based on symbolic execution, constraint solving, and program synthesis. The requirement on the repaired code to pass a given set of tests is formulated as a constraint.
            The work explored the usage of symbolic execution for specification inference, when only tests are available to describe programmer intent. With this work, the authors coined the area of semantic-based program repair. The work on SemFix significantly inspired the ideas explored in our MoE Tier 3 project on <a href="https://nus-apr.github.io">Automated Program Repair</a>!</p>
