#### January, 2023 -- *2023 ICSE MIP Award for SemFix*

<a href="https://abhikrc.com/pdf/ICSE13-SEMFIX.pdf"><img src="{{ 'images/news/semfix.png' | relative_url }}" width="300" alt="SemFix: Program Repair via Semantic Analysis" style="float:right; margin: 0px 15px 15px 15px; border: 1px solid #555;" /></a>

The work <a href="https://abhikrc.com/pdf/ICSE13-SEMFIX.pdf">SemFix</a> on program repair from our group receives the <a href="https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/icseMIPAward.html"><b>Most Influential Paper Award</b></a> from International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2023.

In the paper, the authors present an automated program repair method based on symbolic execution, constraint solving, and program synthesis. The requirement on the repaired code to pass a given set of tests is formulated as a constraint. 
The work explored the usage of symbolic execution for specification inference, when only tests are available to describe programmer intent. With this work, the authors coined the area of semantic-based program repair. The work on SemFix significantly inspired the ideas explored in our MoE Tier 3 project on <a href="https://nus-apr.github.io">Automated Program Repair</a>!

#### August, 2022 -- *5 year research program on <a href="https://nus-apr.github.io">Program Repair</a> starts*

Our 5-year research MoE Tier 3 program on Automated Program Repair starts this month! We will also organize an event hosting several researchers from PL & SE, who give talks specifically focusing on testing, analysis, and repair. Check our [Event Page](https://nus-apr.github.io/launch-event/) for more information, photos, and some of the recordings!
